A bold, creator-first aesthetic that channels TikTok energy into a premium shopping experience. Typography is unapologetically large with extreme weight contrast—ultra-bold display headlines paired with light, airy body text. The color palette centers on deep charcoal black and crisp white with warm cream undertones, punctuated by a single electric coral accent (#FF6B5B) that feels confident without being aggressive. Motion is tactile and immediate—subtle scale transforms on tap, smooth reveals on scroll, and micro-interactions that reward engagement. Layout philosophy prioritizes vertical rhythm for thumb-scrolling, with generous breathing room between sections (80-120px mobile, 120-160px desktop). Glass morphism appears sparingly on floating elements. The overall vibe: if a luxury fashion editorial met a viral creator's link-in-bio, designed by someone who actually understands social commerce. Trademark.
